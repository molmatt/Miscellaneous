    "# Two Examples of Scraping and Chat Bot Creation\n",
    "This notebook details the scraping and creation of two chat bots. Please be kind to the websites used in here and do not excessively burden them by running the scraping cells repeatedly. Especially for iteratively accessing websites. The Prager University scraping is slightly more complex, while the Frankenstein scraping is straightforward. In both cases, making chat bots are easy with markovify, and while they lack the complexity of certain recurrent neural network bots, they end up providing relatively coherent and entertaining sentences."
